To run open up index.html in a web browser.
1. We are building a website that host any type of question. Users who visit the website can respond to questions that are currently active or post new ones. The question disappears within a certain amount of time and can be stored or deleted. 
2. Google API, Snapchat API, Facebook API
3. Google can be used to authenticate login with Gmail.
Snapchat can be used to help figure out how messages disappear.
Facebook can be used to authenticate login since most people have accounts with facebook and use it frequently.
Github Api to check out repositories to see if questions can be directed to there.
5. 2. I choose github API because I it seemed easy to use. Link to documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/
6. This API might not be sufficient in helping us get the information we need.
7. The experience creating this API was easy enough to use. I think the group should keep looking for better options or not use an API at all. The project we are doing does not depend heavily on APIs.
8. The example I wrote might have different information used to check which repositories there are. We might use it to search through users instead.
